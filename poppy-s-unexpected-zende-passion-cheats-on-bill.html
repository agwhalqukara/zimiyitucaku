However, Zende and Poppy made a connection over Luna’s and Zende’s problem, and it’s obvious Zende’s worried about Luna’s pain.</p><h3>B & B Spoilers: Mother And Daughter In The Same Boat</h3><p>When it all comes down to it, mother and daughter are in the same boat because they both popped those narcotic-laced mints. It’s a good possibility they may be a little stronger than merely “edibles” laced with THD, a derivative of marijuana.</p><p><img alt="The Bold and The Beautiful: Zende Forrester Dominguez (Delon de Metz)" width=730 height=430 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/02/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-poppys-unexpected-zende-passion-cheats-on-bill/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Poppy’s Unexpected Zende Passion-Cheats On Bill?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BB-Zende-Forrester-3.jpeg></p><p><a href=#>They’re keeping the secret</a> of what happened that night between Zende and Luna because of those mints, along with Luna. Zende would love to be involved romantically in a more real with Luna, but it’s obvious that’s not going to happen.</p><p>Zende won’t ever get that wish, but perhaps something else might happen-maybe he and Poppy might have a night or two of passion?</p><h3>The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Zende Forrester-Dominguez Finds Himself In Need Of Comfort</h3><p><a href=#>Zende could easily find himself in need of comfort,</a> and Poppy may as well-Zende touched Poppy’s arms in a kind, but suggestive way in a recent B & B episode.</p><p>He had praised Poppy for how well Luna had turned out and he had tried to comfort her. It’s possible the groundwork could be laid for Zende to take a second Nozawa woman to bed, bringing with it many, many complications!</p><p>Zende and Poppy could well find sparks igniting between them, and the sparks lead to a night of passion in spite of Poppy casually seeing Dollar Bill. But what would happen if they were caught in the act, by either Bill or maybe by Luna-that could be dramatic!</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with B & B right now.
