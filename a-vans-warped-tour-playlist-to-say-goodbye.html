We’re also glad to see that some of the bands that started off here get to be a part of its final run.</p><p>And here’s a playlist of some of our favorite artists – it’s a bit empty, so feel free to keep a copy for yourself and add on&nbsp;to it.</p><p>We’re so sad to see Warped Tour go, but we’re also super excited to see all these bands in one day. We’re sort of conflicted on how to feel about letting this go. Especially when some of us have grown up with Warped Tour.</p><p>We’d like to thank Vans for having put this on every summer – we cannot begin to express how thankful we are for allowing people all across the country meet and see some of their favorite artists (especially when these shows are happening in cities that don’t usually get some of these artists during their regular tour dates).</p><p>Are you going to Warped Tour? What date(s)? And who are you most excited to see?</p><p>Feel free to tweet us over @CelebMix and let us know what you think about the end of Warped Tour. And let us know how you feel about this line-up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kw6K60maumqqgmrFuwM6uqWaonJbGrbXSrWSsmalitLC7w5uwnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whatever-happened-to-rent-like-a-champion-after-shark-tank.html><span>←</span><span>Whatever Happened To Rent Like A Champion After Shark Tank?</span></a>
