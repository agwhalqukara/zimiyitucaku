Paul was called to “come on down” not as Aaron Paul, but rather as Aaron Sturtevant. His middle name is Paul, per&nbsp;TV Guide. In his game show appearance, Paul was an incredibly — some might say overly — enthusiastic contestant, and he made it all the way to the Showcase Showdown (via YouTube). He talked about his strategy for getting on the show with Yahoo!, saying he showed up at 4:30 a.m. to wait in line to be in the studio audience wearing a red shirt with a CBS logo on the back. He stayed amped up with a “Big Gulp-sized cup” filled with “six cans of Red Bull.” That is what he believes helped keep him so hyper at the show. “I look like I’m on drugs. I cannot sit still,” he joked. Paul said it was “one of [his] finest performances.”</p><p dir=ltr>Upon getting called, Paul called Barker his “idol,” and he got on stage after winning a desk. The show ended with Paul in the Showcase Showdown, where he could have potentially won a car. He bid $26,500 for his showcase, but he was over the actual price, which was $26,368. So close!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeqO%2BxJqioqaXYq%2BisIyamq2nomLEqbuMsJisZZ%2BjsKZ5wGaaqKakmsC1rc2tZKimXam1pnnPq6CcnV2ewG6%2ByKCfrWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terry-hohm-identified-as-the-victim-of-fatal-i-40-west-crash-in-knoxville.html><span>←</span><span>Terry Hohm Identified as the Victim of Fatal I-40 West Crash in Knoxville</span></a>
