The Chargers also released running back Larry Rountree III to make room on the 53-person roster for Michel in a <a href=# rel=noopener>corresponding move</a>.</p><p>He should offer a solid complement to the speedy Ekeler, giving the Chargers a between-the-tackles grinder and an option in short-yardage situations. It isn't a huge splash for a Chargers team that has made quite a few of them this offseason, adding players like Khalil Mack and J.C. Jackson, but it's a solid move for a team that looks like a real contender.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZGx%2FeIKMrKansV2itqS0xKVkrKGXo8Bur8eaqaCdoqh6pLvNramam6RirqfAxKtkm52Zo7RuvsSlnJqrlZl6o8WMnaalqJieu7Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pat-riley-responds-to-claims-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-news-scores-highlights-st.html><span>←</span><span>Pat Riley Responds to Claims LeBron James Wanted Erik Spoelstra Fired | News, Scores, Highlights, St</span></a>
