He’s cool and all, but he doesn’t need to be there. 😂”</p><p>This person stated: “It had to be said, thank you 😂.” Another critic shared: “Nah, sis, he’s disrespectful to black women.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Brown recently made headlines when it was revealed that the R&B crooner could not see his infant son, Aeko Brown, due to the ongoing Coronavirus crisis.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-GiPwHBDBF/</p><p>Apparently, Aeko and his mother, Ammika Harris, were in Germany when the USA closed its borders for any travelers, and for the time being, it is unknown when they will be able to get back.</p><p>An insider told Hollywood Life: “Chris loves them both so much, and they are everything to him. He knows they’re doing well in Germany and have a lot of support there from Ammika’s family too. Chris is constantly getting updates on how they’re doing, and he loves seeing how much his son is growing up. Chris knows what an amazing mom Ammika is, and he’s completely confident that she’s taking amazing care of Aeko while they’re in Germany.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The pandemic has changed many things.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv4ybqaivnmK5orrDrGSipl2pv7DBwaWcZp6fp3q1tMisZK2hm6m8rHnVopuep12ptaLAjKGcZpyZmXq4tdOhZJpllpa6sMHSZqeeqqOku27Dx6hkppmUmnqzrcKiqq1lk6S6rrHNrapma2hpgnZ8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./weight-coach-emmalea-jackson-shares-how-therapy-led-to-her-losing-212-lbs.html><span>←</span><span>Weight Coach Emmalea Jackson Shares How Therapy Led To Her Losing 212 LBS</span></a>
