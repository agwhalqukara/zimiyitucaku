At one point during the war, she led 7,000 guerilla fighters into a raid of a German gun factory and even killed an SS sentry with her bare hands. One of her comrades described her as “most feminine woman I know, until the fighting starts.

He single-handedly saved 75 soldiers at the battle of Okinawa by lowering wounded soldiers down the ridge. After getting a leg filled with shrapnel from kicking a grenade away from comrades, he took a bullet to the arm and simply crawled back to base rather than occupy a stretcher that someone else might need.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Mariya Oktyabrskaya</h2><img alt="Mariya Oktyabrskaya" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mariya-oktyabrskaya.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>When Nazis invaded her homeland of Kiev and killed her husband, Mariya Oktyabrskaya sold everything she had, bought a T-34 Main Battle Tank for the Red Army, taught herself how to maneuver and repair it, and entered the Nazi-killing business full time. She drove the tank with the words “Fighting Girlfriend” displayed on the turret into a battle in Smolensk, wiped out machine gun nests and repaired the tank mid-battle. She did this on two other separate occasions before the Nazis finally killed her in 1944. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Teddy Roosevelt</h2><img alt="Teddy Roosevelt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teddy-roosevelt.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><a href=#>Teddy Roosevelt</a> has several other titles besides president - including war hero, explorer, Medal of Honor recipient, and Nobel Peace Prize winner.

He stowed aboard a German freighter at age 11; crossing the Atlantic and ending up in London where he became a boxer, vaudevillian performer, the first African-American military pilot in combat. Oh, he also had a rhesus monkey for a sidekick and opened a Paris nightclub where he played drums and partied with Josephine Baker. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Running Eagle</h2><img alt="Running Eagle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/running-eagle.jpg> <span class=caption-body>One of history's only female Indian war chiefs was a Blackfoot woman named Running Eagle, who at age 15 took her murdered dad’s rifle and began attacking enemies with such vigor that the elders sent her on a vision quest to figure out what the heck her destiny was. Apparently, it was to become so kick-ass that other warriors begged her to join her expeditions (also to marry them, but nah). She distinguished herself as an extraordinarily brave chief who was among the first to use guns in battle. </span><span class=credit>Badass of the Week</span><h2 class=title>Warren Crecy</h2><img alt="Warren Crecy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/warren-crecy.png> <span class=caption-body>Dubbed "The Baddest Man In The 761st Tank Battalion" (the first-ever all-black armored unit), Warren G.H Crecy was a Nazi killing machine who was in combat for more than 180 straight days and took out Nazi artillery with a rocket launcher from an exposed position. Credited with 300-400 kills, he won a Silver Star medal and four Purple Hearts. Afterwards, he worked as a prison guard in Nuremberg keeping notorious war criminals in line before going off to fight another war in Korea. </span><span class=credit>Imgur</span><h2 class=title>Leonid Rogozov</h2><img alt="Leonid Rogozov" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/leonid-rogozov.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In 1961, <a href=#>Leonid Rogozov</a> was a Soviet doctor on a team stationed on a remote base in Antarctica, when he realized he had acute appendicitis. Not wanting to cause a fuss, Rogozov wrote in his journal, “It seems that I have appendicitis... I am keeping quiet about it”, and then proceeded to perform an emergency appendectomy on himself under general anesthesia. He was back to work in a couple of weeks. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Michael "Hell Roaring" Healy</h2><img alt="Hell Roaring Healy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hell-roaring-healy.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Already a life-saving legend in the Coast Guard, Michael A. ‘Hell-Roaring’ Healy went on to be the first man of African-American descent to command a U.S. government vessel. He single-handedly patrolled the Alaska coastline for over 20 years as the federal government’s only law enforcement in the vast area, all while earning humanitarian points as judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan natives. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Richard Francis Burton</h2><img alt="Richard Francis Burton" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/richard-francis-burton.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A controversial figure in history, Richard Francis Burton’s keen interest in people’s sexual exploits might detract some from his intellect, but this 19th-century linguist spoke over 20 languages, journeyed to Mecca (in disguise) when it was forbidden and was an army captain in the East India company. He served as British consul, was awarded knighthood, and was a co-translator of the original Kama Sutra.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Edith Garrud</h2><img alt="Edith Garrud" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/edith-garrud.jpg> <span class=caption-body><a href=#>Edith Garrud</a> was one of the first female martial arts teachers in the Western world. She used her skills and knowledge in 1908 to train a team of 30 suffragettes to defend themselves against the police. The England-born Garrud would Jiu-Jitsu her way through cops to protect the movement’s leader, Emmeline Pankhurst, and once said: “Woman is exposed to many perils nowadays, because so many who call themselves men are not worthy of that exalted title.” </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Daniel Inouye</h2><img alt="Daniel Inouye" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/daniel-inouye.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In WWII, Daniel Inouye was on a flanking maneuver against three German machine gun nests, where he took a bullet the stomach while still holding a grenade. Bleeding heavily, he inched towards the final bunker and cocked his arm to throw, but was hit by German fire and the arm holding the grenade was all but severed. But Inouye wrenched the still-live grenade from the meat of his severed appendage and threw it, destroying the nest.<p>Then he was shot in the leg, so his comrades rushed to help, to which he ordered them back to their posts yelling “Nobody called off the war!" He eventually went to a field hospital where they lopped off the rest of the arm with no anesthesia. Later, he went off to become a nine-term U.S. senator for Hawaii.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Hugh Glass</h2><img alt="Hugh Glass" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hugh-glass.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Though it’s difficult to determine how much of <a href=#>Hugh Glass’</a> legend is true and how much is an exaggeration, the basic story is that the American frontiersman and fur trapper was thoroughly mauled by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his fellow explorers. He woke after a few days, let maggots feast on his injuries to prevent infection, and crawled to the Cheyenne River where he fashioned a crude raft and sailed for six weeks to Fort Kiowa surviving on roots and berries. He recuperated and returned to the frontier as a fur trapper, because why the hell not. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Juliane Koepke</h2><img alt="Juliane Koepke" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/juliane-koepke.jpg> <span class=caption-body>On Christmas Eve of 1971, seventeen-year-old Juliane Koepcke was in a plane crash and fell into the Amazon Rainforest without a parachute. With multiple severe injuries and scant food scoured from the wreckage, she hiked for 11 days through vegetation and crocodile-infested waters to finally reach a logging camp. Then she embarked on a seven-hour canoe trip to get to a pilot who could fly her to a hospital. She was the sole survivor of the crash. </span><span class=credit>ERNESTO BENAVIDES/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>John Fairfax</h2><img alt="John Fairfax" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/john-fairfax.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Sure, John Fairfax was the first to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean, but that amazing 1969 feat doesn’t secure his title of badass on its own. He was also a pirate, adventurer, mink farmer, and professional gambler. He also dabbled in smuggling, survived a shark attack, and was kicked out of the Italian boy scouts for shooting live rounds at other kids. </span><span class=credit>Chris Wood/Daily Express/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Larcena Pennington</h2><img alt="Larcena Pennington" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/larcena-pennington.png> <span class=caption-body>23-year old Tucson, Arizona pioneer woman Larcena Pennington was taken captive by Apaches who didn’t appreciate her attempts to escape. They threw her off a short cliff, went down there and stabbed her, and threw rocks at her face till she passed out. They left her for dead, but Larcena woke up three days later, ate some snow, and crawled 15 miles to her husband’s lumber mill, but he was out searching for her; super-worried because she had malaria when she disappeared. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Ching Shih</h2><img alt="Ching Shih" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ching-shih.jpg> <span class=caption-body><a href=#>Ching Shih</a> was a female pirate who terrorized the China Sea in the early 19th century, manning a 300 ship fleet so powerful it kicked the crap out of the Chinese Imperial Navy. Disobeying Shih meant you were beheaded on the spot, and pirates that raped captives were put to death. Even when the fleet was eventually defeated, the Chinese government offered her and the crew amnesty if they surrendered, so Ching got to retire and keep all of her loot.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Ernest Henry Shackleton</h2><img alt="Ernest Henry Shackleton" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ernest-henry-shackleton.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Ernest Henry Shackleton wanted to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent by sea - so he mounted an ocean expedition that ended up involving his ship getting trapped between two ice sheets for 281 days. After a hull breach, the boat sank, and his crew escaped the icy water only to be stranded on an ice sheet with few supplies. Shackleton then sailed 800 miles in a barely seaworthy boat, reached South Georgia Island, and climbed the 4,500-foot tall snow-covered mountains to get help. His entire crew survived.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Loius Zamperini</h2><img alt="Loius Zamperini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/loius-zamperini.jpg> <span class=caption-body><a href=# rel=noopener>Louis Zamperini</a> was as a skinny young Italian in 1920s California that bullies loved to beat on until he took up boxing and dished it right back to them. After busting his tail off at track and field, he ends up on the U.S. Olympic team. But he’s not tired yet, so he flies a plane in WWII, gets shot down, and survives adrift in the shark-laden Pacific Ocean for 47 days. Then he washes ashore into the arms of the Japanese Navy, where he's tortured by war criminals. He returns home a hero, forgives his torturers, fathers some babies, then caps off his life by running a leg in the Olympic Torch relay in Nagano at age 81.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Joe "The Mighty Atom" Greenstein</h2><img alt="Mighty Atom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mighty-atom.jpg> <span class=caption-body>This legendary 5’4” Jewish strongman (who once clobbered 20 Nazis single-handedly) was told at age 14 that he’d probably die from tuberculosis. Instead, Yosselle (Joe) Greenstein ran away, joined the circus, and started training as a strongman. Within two years he was a true superhero, even inspiring a comic book character. He was best known for fighting antisemitism, stopping a bullet with his head, and bending so much metal with his bare hands that the Guinness Record Book came calling. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Malala Yousafzai</h2><img alt="Malala Yousafzai" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/malala-yousafzai.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Not even the Taliban could stop female education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head at age 15 by the fundamentalist organization on her bus home from school.
