As a kid, she graduated from styling her father's hair to styling her little friends on the block to being the go-to girl for trendy, unique styles.</p><p class=align-left>Despite this natural talent, things weren't easy for Judy. She was sneaking her friends into her house and doing hair for free in her bedroom.

Jesseca was in her element, and she loved creating new and unique styles and exploring colour.</p><p class=align-left>After a while, Judy became the co-owner of a salon. She was focused on her work and took clients on Sundays, Mondays and holidays when most stylists would never. This allowed her to charge a premium price and stack her coins. During this time, she took an interest in social media and developed her online persona, Judy.

She revealed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beauty Independent </a>that she had miscarried twins between 17 and 19.</p>It was difficult because of the workload it required. I transferred from that school to the cosmetology school. When I got pregnant with the twins before I miscarried, my mom put me out because she felt like she couldn't keep supporting me. Ultimately, getting put out made me the strong independent person that I am today, so I'm thankful she did that.<p class=align-left>Jesseca Dupart's son is Byron Jr. Her other two children are Jay and Deja.</p><h3>Is Jesseca Dupart a millionaire?</h3><p class=align-left>Judy has made a fortune from her career as an entrepreneur.
