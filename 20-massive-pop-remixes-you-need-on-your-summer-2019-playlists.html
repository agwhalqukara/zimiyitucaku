But fear not summer lovers, CelebMix is on hand to countdown 20 essential pop remixes you need to hear.</p><p><strong>1. ‘Summertime Sadness [Lana Del Rey vs. Cedric Gervais]’, Lana Del Rey & Cedric Gervais</strong></p><p></p><p>Dating back to 2013, but proving to be a timeless classic, Cedric Gervais’ club twist on Lana Del Rey’s brooding ‘Summertime Sadness’ turns the track from a late-night plod to a beach party anthem. Hitting Top 5 chart positions across the world and being certified multi-platinum, it’s as heavyweight a remix as you’ll find.</p><p><strong>2. ‘Malibu – Alan Walker Remix’, Miley Cyrus</strong></p><p></p><p>Miley Cyrus’ 2017 comeback kicked off with a sultry summer single in ‘Malibu’. Alan Walker is a DJ who knows all about hits, see ‘Faded’ and last year’s ‘Darkside’, and adds his flair to Cyrus’ California-inspired hit.</p><p><strong>3. ‘Con Calma – Remix’, Daddy Yankee, Katy Perry & Snow</strong></p><p></p><p>Following in the steps of past summer smashes ‘Despacito’ and ‘Reggaton Lento’, Daddy Yankee ropes in Katy Perry to spice up Hispanic hit ‘Con Calma’, which she does just so well.</p><p><strong>4. ‘I Don’t Care (with Justin Bieber)’ – Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber & Jonas Blue&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>Little needed be done to Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber’s gloriously catchy ‘I Don’t Care’. But if you want to entrust an already iconic song to one man ahead of summer, Jonas Blue is the first name that springs to mind.</p><p><strong>5. ‘What About Us – Cash Cash Remix’, P!nk&nbsp;& Cash Cash</strong></p><p></p><p>After releasing one of 2019’s most underrated records in <a href=#>Hurts 2B Human</a>,&nbsp;P!nk&nbsp;should be at the top of your summer playlists this year as Cash Cash put their spin on 2017 single ‘What About Us’. P!nk’s unwavering unapologetic sound mixed with the group’s EDM expertise, it’s one to play loud.</p><p><strong>6. ‘Shots – Broiler Remix’, Imagine Dragons & Broiler</strong></p><p></p><p>Taking Imagine Dragons back a couple of eras to 2015 and sophomore record&nbsp;Smoke + Mirrors,&nbsp;you’ll be reminded of tracks like ‘Gold’, ‘I Bet My Life’ and ‘Shots’. Broiler’s take on the latter featured on the album and is the perfect summer mix.</p><p><strong>7. ‘The Way I Are (Dance With Somebody) [DallasK Remix]’, Bebe Rexha & DallasK</strong></p><p></p><p>Bebe Rexha’s Lil Wayne-featured version of Whitney Houston’s classic largely flew under the rader back in 2017. DallasK chop out Lil Wayne and add some much needed oomph to the single.</p><p><strong>8. ‘That’s What I Like – Alan Walker Remix’, Bruno Mars & Alan Walker</strong></p><p></p><p>Alan Walker makes another appearance on the list as he remixes Bruno Mars’ ‘That’s What I Like’ from the singer’s Grammy-award winning album,&nbsp;24K Magic.</p><p><strong>9. ‘Boys – Nevada Remix’, Charli XCX & Nevada</strong></p><p></p><p>Love or hate Charli XCX’s ‘Boys’, it’s pretty much as infectious as pop tracks come. Nevada turn the simple flick into a dancefloor-sized remix.</p><p><strong>10. ‘I Miss Myself – R3HAB Remix’, NOTD, HRVY & R3HAB</strong></p><p></p><p>Between ‘<a href=#>Told You So</a>‘, ‘<a href=#>I Miss Myself</a>‘ and ‘<a href=#>Don’t Need Your Love</a>‘, HRVY has been churning out summery bangers over the past couple of months. Serial remixer R3HAB puts a spin on recent NOTD collaboration ‘I Miss Myself’ to keep fans ticking over as they wait for more HRVY tracks.</p><p><strong>11. ‘New Rules – Initial Talk Remix’, Dua Lipa & Initial Talk</strong></p><p></p><p>Back in 2017, ‘<a href=#>New Rules</a>‘ went from the song of the summer to just about the track of the year as Dua Lipa rose to pop stardom. Initital Talk are the 80s-inspired outfit who love to throw chart hits back a few decades (check out their take on Lipa’s ‘IDGAF too) and turn heads on their remix of the songstress’ all-powerful rules.</p><p><strong>12. ‘Call On Me – Ryan Riback Remix’, Starley&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>Another remix that boasts that knack of never getting old, <a href=#>Starley’s</a> team up with Ryan Riback is an anthem perfect for a late holiday night. The Aussie is currently in the studio working on her debut album… another summer smash on the way for 2020 perhaps?</p><p><strong>13. ‘There’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back (NOTD Remix)’, Shawn Mendes & NOTD</strong></p><p></p><p>Shawn Mendes may be sending his fandom into an early summer meltdown on recent Camila Cabello collaboration, but when the Mendes-army are done getting over the ‘<a href=#>Señorita</a>‘ music video, NOTD’s take on ‘There’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back’ from 2017 will be the next to grab their attention this summer.</p><p><strong>14. ‘Galway Girl – Martin Jensen Remix’, Ed Sheeran & Martin Jensen</strong></p><p></p><p>Changing any track of Ed Sheeran’s household favourite&nbsp;<a href=#>Divide</a> is a dangerous task. However, Martin Jensen’s tropical EDM sound is the perfect ingredient for summer jigs to ‘Galway Girl’.</p><p><strong>15. ‘Never Be Like You – Martin Solveig Remix’, Flume, Kai & Martin Solveig</strong></p><p></p><p>Two of the industry’s great DJ minds collide as Fume meets Martin Solveig on the latter’s remix of ‘Never Be Like You’. Nearly 5-minutes long, it’s a dance track to get you ready for summer clubbing.</p><p><strong>16. ‘Hands To Myself – Kandy Remix’, Selena Gomez & KANDY</strong></p><p></p><p>Bored of waiting for a new Selena Gomez album? Well, so are we. It’s been a long three years since 2016’s&nbsp;Revival, but Kandy’s take on ‘Hands To Myself’ from that record helps the nostalgia.</p><p><strong>17. ‘Sun In Our Eyes – Don Diablo Remix’, Mø, Diplo & Don Diablo</strong></p><p></p><p>Good friends Mø and Diplo are no strangers to a hit. From Mø’s ‘XXX 8’ to Major Lazer’s ‘Lean On’ and ‘Cold Water’ to Diplo’s ‘Get It Right’ – they are a dream pairing. Last year they joined forces once again on ‘Sun In Our Eyes’, which Don Diablo beefs up.</p><p><strong>18. ‘High Five – Hazers Remix’, Sigrid & Hazers</strong></p><p></p><p>One artist jetting around the world on <a href=#>festival shows this summer is Sigrid</a>. It’s been a busy breakthrough year for the Norweigan after she released her <a href=#>debut record&nbsp;Sucker Punch</a>. ‘High Five’ was one of a few tracks to not make the cut for the album, but with a Hazers remix to hand it isn’t disappearing anytime soon.</p><p><strong>19. ‘Golden Years – M-Phazes Remix’, Ruel & M-Phazes</strong></p><p></p><p>Ruel was only 14-years-old when M-Phazes brought him onto ‘Golden Years’ after being stunned by the youngster’s cover of James Bay’s ‘Let It Go’. ‘Golden Years’ would be the debut single to <a href=#>start a crazy two years</a> of hits, awards and <a href=#>sell-out shows</a> for Ruel.</p><p><strong>21. Friends (with BloodPop & Julia Michaels) [Remix], Justin Bieber & BloodPop&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>Bringing Julia Michaels onto ‘Friends’ in 2017 might not have been a move that many fans were expecting from Justin Bieber, but it sure does make a duet destined for summer playlists.</p><p><strong>Are your favourite remixes on our list?
