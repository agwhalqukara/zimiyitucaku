Crochet's stock has skyrocketed this season, as he is firmly in the AL Cy Young conversation.</p><p>Another factor impacting Chicago's asking price is Crochet won't hit free agency until after the 2026 season. He is only making <a href=# rel=noopener>$800,000</a> this season in his first year of arbitration.</p><p>There is an elevated injury risk with Crochet, beyond just the normal concern that comes with being a pitcher in this current era of MLB. He missed all of 2022 after undergoing <a href=# rel=noopener>Tommy John surgery</a> and only appeared in 13 games out of the bullpen in 2023.</p><p>The 94.1 innings Crochet has thrown this season is 24.1 more than he had in the previous four years combined (73.0). This is also his first year as a starting pitcher after pitching exclusively out of the bullpen from 2020 to '23.</p><p>Crochet has done a fantastic job of alleviating some of the injury concerns so far this season. The 25-year-old is currently leading the AL in strikeouts (<a href=# rel=noopener>130</a>) and MLB in strikeouts per nine innings (<a href=# rel=noopener>12.4</a>).</p><p>If Crochet continues at that pace for the rest of 2024, he could be the most impactful player acquired by a contending team during the season.</p><p>The White Sox are smart to prioritize trading Crochet now to potentially avoid a situation where he could get injured later and lose some of his value. They own the worst record in MLB this season at 24-61. Their 46-win pace would be the <a href=# rel=noopener>second-fewest</a> in a 162-game season in MLB history, ahead of the 2003 Detroit Tigers (43-119).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuDeoKMpqObZaSnrqWxjKuspqeiqHqordGrnK2sXZi%2FsK%2FHnqtmr5iewaZ50qivZqyRobhur86nq6uZk6l6pbvDoJyrq11mgW7AxJqkrGWVrrJuv88%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bethenny-frankel-is-providing-20-million-worth-of-emergency-supplies-to-ukraine.html><span>←</span><span>Bethenny Frankel Is Providing $20 Million Worth Of Emergency Supplies To Ukraine</span></a>
