expectation that time would be required for adjustment, it has been accepted and taken onboard by the players in an impressive manner.</p><p>However, concerns had been raised in recent weeks over an apparent lack of ‘plan B’, where sides had matched up the Baggies’ formation and style and managed to frustrate them and earn unentertaining draws as a result.</p><p>After struggling to draws over Millwall, Derby County and Preston North End, West Brom faced Queens Park Rangers at home last time out.</p><p>The unbeaten start appeared to be coming to an end after falling behind in the first minute, but a <a href=# title="More Karlan Grant"><strong class=autotag>Karlan Grant</strong></a> double in the second half, including a late winner, completely changed the outlook heading into the
