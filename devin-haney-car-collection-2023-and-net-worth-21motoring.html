As, this doesn’t offer the SUV’s legendary off-road capability, but rather it is effortlessly elegant styling, an opulent cabin, and the A-list status that it’s developed over the years. Starting with a turbocharged inline-six with a 48-volt hybrid system named P400. This churns out 395 hp. On testing, it proved to be buttery-smooth and provided enough juice to pull the large-bodied Rover around. While a 523-hp twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 engine; Land Rover named it P530 is even vivacious and cranks up the Range Rover’s towing capacity to 8200 pounds.</p><h3 id=4-rolls-royce-cullinan class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading"><span id=4_Rolls_Royce_Cullinan>4.

With the&nbsp;Rolls-Royce Cullinan, the British luxury carmaker has offered the best of their craftsmanship packed into a high-riding practical design. It seems practicality is an overstatement to call, the Cullinan offers a badge of prestige with a refinement the brand is known for. From its brilliantly designed exterior to a handstitched interior made with precise and rich materials. The new Rolls SUV offers a super-refined V12 that makes 563 hp that delivers a buttery smooth drive.</p><h3 id=5-chevrolet-corvette-c8 class="rb-heading-index-5 wp-block-heading"><span id=5_Chevrolet_Corvette_C8>5.

This new C8 has received a mid-engined revamp, and it was so exciting. Finally, an American mid-engined performance car is within the reach of every average buyer also. The C8’s design caused some dismay with the angular, showy exterior and the unique interior that cocoons the driver in an ergonomically deficient cockpit.</p><h3 id=6-lamborghini-urus class="rb-heading-index-6 wp-block-heading"><span id=6_Lamborghini_Urus>6.

Not only to justify its twin-turbo 4.0-Litre V8 making between 641 and 657 horsepower, but also by its mind-splattering performance on famous racetracks. This high-riding Lambo is the only thing from the brand that can pull a trailer and haul more than two. While its quarter-million-dollar price puts it way out of the league for most of us mere mortals, its interior isn’t as special as it should be for such a huge wad of cash.</p><h3 id=7-bmw-i8 class="rb-heading-index-7 wp-block-heading"><span id=7_BMW_i8>7.

The design of the&nbsp;i8&nbsp;was so futuristic and cutting-edge that it made headlines the moment BMW introduced it. There weren’t any cars in the market that looked as refreshing and as appealing to the people. BMW flaunted this i8 for its amazing design and sustainability. The i8 came with a 1.5-liter&nbsp;three-cylinder&nbsp;engine combined with electric motors that delivered a good&nbsp;228 hp&nbsp;and&nbsp;236&nbsp;lb-ft&nbsp;of torque. The car was so good in terms of aerodynamics that it has a drag coefficient of just&nbsp;0.26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqYaK8tbvRoqWgZpOkunCwxK%2Bgp2WYlrumxYycmKtlk6S5rbHCraCopl1nfXN%2FjJyYq6tdpLNusMSvoKdlmJa7psWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-martin-dishes-on-what-it-was-like-to-struggle-with-homophobic-feelings-toward-himself.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Martin Dishes On What It Was Like To Struggle With Homophobic Feelings Toward Himself</span></a>
