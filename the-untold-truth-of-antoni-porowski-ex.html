Their fans were saddened by the news – reportedly, they were very close and “basically married” as Porowski stated in an interview.</p><p>The actor credited his ex-boyfriend for helping him come out as gay to his family – he shared a heartfelt story about how he was on a ‘plane on the tarmac thinking that if the plane crashed his parents would never know that he’s gay, and it was then that the actor sent his father an email reading “I think it’s time I tell you: I love. I am loved. His name is Joey, and we live together.” He then said that his sexuality is something private and intimate, and isn’t something he’s ashamed of.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>After seven years, Antoni Porowski and Joey Krietemeyer have broken up and we just hope they're both practicing all the self care. <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/B3cMoQWRz0</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/M1eEfAiJXt</a></p><p>— E!
