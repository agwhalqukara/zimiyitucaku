So, she spoke up. He started playing "free."&lt;br>&lt;br>Our profile on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Packers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Packers&lt;/a> safety, icymi: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TSBxb768Xs">https://t.co/TSBxb768Xs&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/tzrqZIhUPi">pic.twitter.com/tzrqZIhUPi&lt;/a></p><p><i>"It messed me up because it's like: 'My lady is telling me this, so do I really need to...' but she knows what she's talking about when it comes to mental health. When she said that, it kind of hit me: 'Man, I guess I am.'"</i></p><p>Owens went on to explain that after seeing a team psychologist to discuss what was holding him back, he has since been able to play without mental restrictions: "I'm playing free. I addressed stuff that I didn't know I was struggling with. But [Biles] brought it to my attention. Once you do that mental work? Your mind is a powerful weapon."</p><p>The 28-year-old Owens is in the midst of his fifth NFL season and his first with the Packers after spending his first four campaigns as a member of the Houston Texans.</p><p>An undrafted player out of Missouri Western State, Owens played sparingly his first three seasons before starting all 17 games at safety for the Texans last season and finishing with a career-high 125 tackles.</p><p>Owens did not begin his first season in Green Bay as a starter, but he was inserted into the starting lineup after Darnell Savage got injured, and he never looked back, starting the final 11 games of the regular season.</p><p>He finished the season with 84 tackles and one sack, and made some splash plays after becoming a starter, including forcing a fumble in a Week 9 win over the Los Angeles Rams and returning a fumble for a touchdown in a 29-22 upset of the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving.</p><p>Owens has played so solidly that he earned the start in the Packers' NFC Wild Card Round playoff win over the Dallas Cowboys last weekend, recording four tackles.</p><p>It comes as little surprise that Biles was able to help Owens gain a mental edge, as she is arguably the best athlete in the history of gymnastics.</p><p>The 26-year-old member of the United States Olympic team has won seven Olympic medals during her career, including gold in the all-around and team events in 2016.</p><p>Biles entered the 2020 Olympics as the heavy favorite to repeat as all-around champion, but a case of "the twisties" caused her to pull out of the event and a few other events she was scheduled to take part in.</p><p>The twisties are something of a mental block that occurs when gymnasts lose control of what they're doing with their bodies while in the air, which creates a potentially dangerous situation.</p><p>Biles was able to overcome the twisties and compete in the balance beam at the 2020 Summer Games, taking home a bronze medal.</p><p>She has also put herself in position to potentially earn a spot on the 2024 Olympic team, which speaks to Biles' perseverance.</p><p>Owens has persevered in his own right this season, and he has helped put his team just two wins away from a Super Bowl berth.</p><p>On Saturday night, Owens and the Packers will look to keep their surprising playoff run going when they face the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Round.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqGcYCMqZico5WnwG62zqeYraCRo3qww8SnqmaqlauyorjSZpidrpmYsm6y0aikZquZoryvsYyboKWdo2LBqa3TZqOenF2pvG61zKmpqK6VmXqxuMCy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-rinna-says-harry-hamlin-is-her-hero-after-25-years-of-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Rinna says Harry Hamlin is her hero after 25 years of marriage</span></a>
