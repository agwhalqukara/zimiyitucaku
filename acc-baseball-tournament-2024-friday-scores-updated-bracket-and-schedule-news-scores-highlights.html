A Griff O'Ferrall home run would make it 4-2 in the sixth, but the Seminoles put up seven in the top of the seventh to hold an 11-2 lead.</p><p>Virginia would get five back in the bottom of the inning, but an additional Seminole run in the eighth would give the game it's final score.</p><p>James Tibbs had two hits, including a home run, and five overall RBIs to lead Florida State. Alex Lodise and Drew Faurot each contributed three hits and an RBI as well.</p><p><b>Clemson 8, Louisville 7</b></p><p>The second game of the day had little implications on the tournament, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a classic.</p><p>Miami had already defeated both Clemson and Louisville and had claimed Pool B, so the final matchup was simply for positioning within the College World Series landscape.

The Cardinals scored six runs across the first four innings to take a 6-0 lead. That's where the Tigers began to Chip away, eventually cutting the deficit to 6-4.</p><p>Louisville would add a run in the top of the seventh, but Clemson delivered a dagger when Jimmy Obertop smashed a three-run home run to tie the game at seven.</p>Clemson Baseball <span class=acct>@ClemsonBaseball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>TIE BALLGAME!!!!!!!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jobertop_4?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jobertop_4&lt;/a> belts a three-run homer to even it up!&lt;br>&lt;br>🚀 345 ft&lt;br>💨 104 mph&lt;br>&lt;br>B8 || LOU 7, CU 7&lt;br>&lt;br>🖥 &lt;a href="https://t.co/fUM14bJESD">https://t.co/fUM14bJESD&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xq2DTaSUGU">pic.twitter.com/Xq2DTaSUGU&lt;/a></p><p>Louisville would not muster a run in the top of the ninth, and Clemson eventually walked off via a bases-loaded walk to Overtop in the bottom of the inning.</p><p><b>Wake Forest 9, North Carolina 8 (12)</b></p><p>Nine innings wasn't going to be enough to determine the winner between Wake Forest and North Carolina.</p><p>The Demon Deacons advanced after a four-run explosion in the top of the 12th, pulling the upset over the top-seeded Tar Heels and earning a spot in the semifinals.</p>Wake Forest Baseball <span class=acct>@WakeBaseball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>There's a party downtown near 5th St. 🤠&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTFY?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MTFY&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoDeacs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoDeacs&lt;/a> 🎩 &lt;a href="https://t.co/yifiqxCHwd">pic.twitter.com/yifiqxCHwd&lt;/a></p><p>The Demon Deacons went up 4-0 and were riding high off of a stellar performance from ace pitcher Chase Burns.

North Carolina scored three in the bottom of the seventh and two in the eighth to take a 5-4 lead and were just three outs away from a win.</p><p>With a runner on first, two outs and a 3-2 count in the bottom of the ninth, Wake Forest's Nick Kurtz wasn't ready to go home.</p>Wake Forest Baseball <span class=acct>@WakeBaseball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>We play on 😤 &lt;a href="https://t.co/SrzXbvmrBL">https://t.co/SrzXbvmrBL&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/vwnTX9lIMN">pic.twitter.com/vwnTX9lIMN&lt;/a></p><p>Neither team would score in the first two extra innings before the four-run onslaught in the 12th from Wake Forest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeCcYWMmpqcZZKWwKauwKWjZqyfqr%2Bvrcyepa1lYmV%2FdXnFq6CdmaliwKS70Z6qZq2gma61scNmmauZk6CytXnAp5tmq5OdsqXBy54%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woodman-l-frank-baum-character.html><span>←</span><span>___ Woodman (L.
