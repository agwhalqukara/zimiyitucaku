<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Racing Legend Danica Patrick Shares Swimsuit Photo From Hawaii</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Danica Patrick is heating up Hawaii in her swimsuit. In a recent social media post, the racecar driver shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit while vacationing in the tropics. "Had the best 2 days in Hawaii! I think I underestimate how little time (when spent right) it takes to relax and re-energize," she captioned the series of snaps, which included many of herself on the beach. How does the 41-year-old approach diet and fitness? Celebwell rounded up her top health habits.</p><p>In her recent social media post, Danica revealed that self-care is crucial. "For me that's… nature, walking, slow mornings, massage, music, sunrises/sunsets, laughing…. And all of that leads to me feeling really grateful, which is a powerful emotion," she said.</p><p>Danica has been spending a lot of time on the golf course. "I found the trick to golfing. Barefoot and bikinis," she captioned a post. "Got a few days of much needed time off for my brain." In her post from Hawaii she added that she played golf "with the CEO." A comprehensive review published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that golf's health benefits are extensive, including mind, body, and even lifespan. Benefits include improved longevity, decreased risk of developing heart disease or suffering a stroke, good mental health, and improved strength and balance.</p><p>"The only reliable way to change your reality is to change your perception. Happiness is not outside of you, it's the way you see things," Danica captioned a recent post of herself doing yoga. There is a laundry list of reasons to do yoga, explains Harvard Health. "Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at least four years, gained less weight during middle adulthood," they said. "People who were overweight actually lost weight. Overall, those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs) compared with those who did not practice yoga. Researchers attributed this to mindfulness. Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1362872558.jpg><p>Danica is a fan of green juice. On her Instagram Stories, she shared her version of St. Patrick's Day spirits, a cup of "drs orders" green juice, and an "immunity shot with oil of oregano." As for her diet, Danica eats incredibly clean, consuming lots of plants with lean meats, like salmon, bison, or ground beef sprinkled in. She also loves healthy fats like avocado, and eats a lot of eggs.<span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p>Danica makes her workouts count. She lifts incredibly heavy weights instead of doing several reps of lighter ones. On the fitness tab of her Instagram accounts she shares lots of her workouts. In one of them, she deadlifts 255 pounds. She also planks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLOtwqKloGWcmrSmusNmm5qmmZiubrzAramim5tiwKmt0Z6qZqunnrq0wcitZKmgn6m8brLRqKRmoJGsrqq1jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lady-gets-into-trouble-after-african-mom-finds-her-husband-doing-the-housework-while-she-rests-peep.html><span>←</span><span>Lady Gets Into Trouble After African Mom Finds Her Husband Doing the Housework While She Rests, Peep</span></a>
