The notorious producer recently took to his social media to suggest that <a href=# title="Future And Bow Wow’s Baby Mama, Joie Chavis, Wins The Web With Epic Dance Video — She Left The Competition Far Behind">Bow Wow</a> didn’t have enough hits to be on Verzuz.</p><p>Hot New Hip Hop said today that Bow Wow has commented on the Verzuz battles, arguing he’s not overly interested in them even though fans want to see him on one. Bow Wow wrote on his account in response to some of the requests: “NOT GONNA HAPPEN.” “I don’t want to battle,” the artist wrote.</p><p>In case you missed it, fans had asked him to go up against Fabolous, which he had initially agreed too, however, now, he seems uninterested. The organizer of Verzuz, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timbaland,</a> took to his account to say Bow Wow didn’t even have enough hits to go on it.</p><p>Timbaland wrote on his account that Bow Wow might not even have “20 in the bag.” Obviously, Bow Wow didn’t appreciate it because he took the time to respond. Bow Wow said to him in response, “you been drinking too much Ciroc.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKne7NB-B1/</p><p>He then went on to say that his era and the height of his career was “nothing to play with.”&nbsp;According to Hot New Hip Hop, it looks like Timbaland was just trying to get Bow Wow to participate, but it looks like he’s not going to do it.</p><p>Of course, this won’t be the first time that Bow Wow has been in the news headlines. Earlier this year, a video surfaced in which the rapper appeared to be having sexual intercourse <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with an unidentified woman on a yacht</a>, however, it was unclear.</p><p>The Shade Room was the first to pick up on the video. Social media users hypothesized that Shad Moss, also known as Bow Wow, was giving her oral s*x and she wasn’t happy about it.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Hot New Hip Hop speculated on the date of the video’s creation, arguing that it probably took place over Memorial Day weekend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because the rapper</a> had shared another clip on his social media in which the same yacht was included.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSpMRuw86wZKudo6W8r7DSZquoZaSeuqOty5qlnatdmLyuucSnq6xlpJ2utXnHnmSdp5Wou7V5x5qtnmWVo7y2s8dmn6KsXai8r7PSZquoZZKaerC6jK%2Bcq7Klr3p1fpBybWxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bio-age-net-worth-single-nationality-height-career.html><span>←</span><span>Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Height, Career</span></a>
