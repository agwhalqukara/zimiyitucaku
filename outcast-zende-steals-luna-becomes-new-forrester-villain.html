It would hurt Zende to see his talent pushed aside for an inexperienced newbie, and Ridge’s decision smacks of nepotism.</p><h3>B&B spoilers: Eric Forrester’s Dilemma</h3><p>Zende and Eric have collaborated in the past but Eric chose RJ to help him after learning he is dying. And, when Ridge could have told Zende about Eric, he told Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor) first because he’s “family.”</p><p><a href=#>This is not the first time Ridge has been a jerk,</a> remember when he threw out Eric’s treasured stapler and told him to just play pickleball already?</p><h3>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers: Will Zende Turn on His Family?</h3><p>Zende is whining to Luna Nozawa (Lisa Yamada) about his situation and Luna has been very sympathetic. Plus the show has made it a point to portray Luna as being like her loose mom Poppy Nozawa (Romy Park).</p><p>Is the writing on the wall B&B fans, is Zende about to betray his family by taking his cousin’s girl?</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with B&B right now.
