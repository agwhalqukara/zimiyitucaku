"Every college athlete I know is obsessed with Livvy as well. It was a no-brainer for us."</p><p>Dunne has the third-highest NIL valuation at On3 (<a href=# rel=noopener>$3.7 million</a>), which trails only Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders and USC guard Bronny James. Thanks to her 13.2 million followers across multiple social media platforms, the 21-year-old has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the NIL era.</p><p>On3 lists Nautica, Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions, Body Armour, Grubhub and American Eagle among her <a href=# rel=noopener>endorsements</a>.</p><p>Signing an NIL deal with Passes would seemingly point toward Dunne's return or at least the continuation of her college career. The New Jersey native was a senior on the Tigers' national championship-winning squad but has an additional year of eligibility that was granted amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Should Dunne decide to explore avenues outside LSU, her massive popularity would likely open doors at a lot of other schools.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW6BdX6Mpaquq12htrfC2Gabrqaemnqis9GenKxlpKR6rsHLraCmoZyhtrC6jJ2mpaSRp3qvtctmmqimpKeupMCMsKCtoF2lrrS%2FxKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kid-who-s-hard-to-control.html><span>←</span><span>Kid who's hard to control</span></a>
