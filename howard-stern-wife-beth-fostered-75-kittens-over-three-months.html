"It's my joy!"</p><p>While fans of the Sirius shock jock Stern, 60, may be familiar with he and his wife's late English bulldog Bianca, they might not realize the menagerie of other animals the Sterns keep at their New York City home. "We fostered an English bulldog last year, and we've been fostering cats," Beth told <strong>Us</strong>. "We're up to 75 kittens since last June. We find them all loving homes."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A pet lover who has her own charity, Bianca's Furry Friends Campaign — with proceeds benefitting the North Shore Animal League in Long Island, New York — Stern takes every opportunity possible to remember her beloved bulldog Bianca, whose name she and her husband both got tattooed on their arms.</p><p>"She was the light of my life. My husband and I adopted her together, and she became our world," the activist — whose children's book, Yoda: The Story of a Cat and His Kittens, hits stores in November — told <strong>Us</strong>. "[The tattoo] is a happy memory."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2Bor5GnsW6%2F056pp2WnnrOmecGeq6FllqTAtbHRnptmb2ViuKrA056lrGWfq7KzedOhqZ6dXaK8r8DHrGRraGFpfnJ9kA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ernest-borgnine.html><span>←</span><span>Ernest Borgnine</span></a>
