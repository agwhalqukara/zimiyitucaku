Alexander, who played attorney Maxine Shaw on “Living Single,” said while reboots of “<a href=# rel=noopener>Martin</a>” and “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>” are great, doing the same for her sitcom isn’t in the cards.</p><p>“I think it’s great people are nostalgic for things in the past, maybe for good reason. It happens,” she says on “The Breakfast Club” Thursday, March 22, “But for me, I always tried to be honest and said that if my film and television career had been a lot better, I might not have any problem dipping my toe back in to that water and going and doing the Max character. But for me … time is so finite. You have so little time. I think I just want to see if I can do other things. And see if I can get people as happy for me or into a different character in a different way.”</p><p>Alexander added that while she’ll “never say never,” as a child of orphans and a deceased&nbsp;father, she knows that tomorrow is not promised.</p><p>The actress, who comes from a dramatic background, played the comedic lawyer for six seasons on “Living Single,” which ran from 1993 to 1998. Last year, Queen Latifah, who played Flavor magazine publisher and editor&nbsp;Khadijah James, said a <a href=# rel=noopener>reboot </a>was in the works.</p><p>“We’re actually working on it,” she said on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.” “It’s not there yet. But, hopefully, we can get it happening.”</p><p>She said the goal would be to talk to the original cast that was involved, but Alexander confirmed everyone’s favorite attorney at law won’t be included.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX55e49sZmtqX6G2t7XNoGSsoZ6cuaZ50Z6ZqKekYsSwutNmoKebnKqxprCMppixoZ6aerS0wLBkmqykpL%2Bvsdhmo5qvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tracee-ellis-ross-net-worth-age-height-hair-products-who-is-she-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Tracee Ellis Ross' net worth, age, height, hair products, who is she dating?</span></a>
