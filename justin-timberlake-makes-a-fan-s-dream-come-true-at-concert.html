I will never tire of opening articles about him that way. He is just the all-singing, all-dancing, all-acting superman. Dude can do it all. Justin Timberlake makes music, movies, and he also makes fans dreams come true by doing the coolest stuff ever. What am I talking about? Well, let’s just say he had two fans at his show on Sunday who will never forget the moment they shared with Timberlake, and the whole audience.</p><p><a href=#>MTV has the scoop</a>, but the long and short is, Justin Timberlake stopped his show on Sunday to let one of his lifelong fans propose to his girlfriend. Think about how epic that would be for the guy? Oh, and what woman in her right mind would say no to that? That redefines epic proposal for sure.</p><p>So a guy named Josh called J.T’s people about proposing at his Kentucky stop, and they were all about it. Justin Timberlake makes this happen by stopping his show in the middle and calling the two on stage. At which point, Josh drops on one knee in front of his lady and all the crowd goes inside with cheers. Flash forward, she said yes.</p><p>So yes, Justin Timberlake makes movies, and makes music, and makes us laugh on SNL. But the real kicker is, for these two, Justin Timberlake makes dreams comes true.</p><p>See, I told you he was the man.</p><p>(Photo by Buda Mendes/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGihrquknrtuwMimmZ6qnJa4pnnMmqKeq12WeqetzaxknaqVlrpur86mnGasoqqybq3TZpqoppOav7V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chrissy-teigen-gets-emotional-during-surprise-ellen-visit-with-husband-john-legend-watch-h.html><span>←</span><span>Chrissy Teigen Gets Emotional During Surprise Ellen Visit with Husband John Legend Watch H</span></a>
