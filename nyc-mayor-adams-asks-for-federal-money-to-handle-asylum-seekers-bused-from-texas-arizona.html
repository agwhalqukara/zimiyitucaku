We have for sure called on the federal government to work across state lines to prevent people from really being tricked into getting on buses,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“We think they’re largely asylum seekers who are going to final destinations that are not Washington, D.C. I worked with the White House to make sure that FEMA provided a grant to a local organization that is providing services to folks,” Bowser continued. “I fear that they’re being tricked into nationwide bus trips when their final destinations are places all over the United States of America.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/640/320/GettyImages-1240242369.jpg><p>Mayor Muriel Bowser discusses rising violence at a press conference, in Washington, DC. &nbsp;<br><span class=copyright>(Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)</span></p><p><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></p><p>Texas Gov.
