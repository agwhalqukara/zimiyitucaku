She was held on suspicion of homicide and conspiracy.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>On April 1</a>, Isaiah Reupena, 34, was arrested by San Mateo detectives on suspicion of homicide at his home in Blanchard, Oklahoma, and was awaiting extradition.</p><p>Both were arrested in the Dec. 19 shooting death of 30-year-old Bay Area rapper <a href=#>Melota Lemafa Lasi Jr.</a>, known as Cutty Banks, in San Mateo, police said.</p><p>Both are alleged to have taken part in a “street investigation” to identify the killer of 27-year-old Lewis Reupena, who was fatally shot driving on the freeway in Seal Beach on Aug. 29. Through this investigation, they allegedly pegged Lasi as the killer, however, the California Highway Patrol had ruled out Lasi’s involvement in the Southern California freeway shooting, according to police.</p><p>Young allegedly convinced Isaiah Reupena of Lasi’s guilt, causing him to drive to San Mateo, police said. Reupena then shot and killed Lasi, then drove back to Southern California, abandoned the car he used to drive to Northern California and then moved to Oklahoma, according to police.</p><p>Young is also alleged to have moved to Oklahoma with Reupena’s family, but returned to Southern California prior to her arrest.</p><p>Lewis Reupena was a music artist named “Looce” who lived in Orange County, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS Los Angeles</a>.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS%2Fs63NnJxmr5%2Birq95wKupnqukmrFutc1mpKKrpJa4prqMoptmo5mhuaq6xmarop2UYsGwedKemKVlkpqupLSMoaamoZOesaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-trailer-for-jojo-siwa-s-siwas-dance-pop-revolution-show-is-here.html><span>←</span><span>The Trailer for JoJo Siwa's 'Siwas Dance Pop Revolution' Show Is Here</span></a>
