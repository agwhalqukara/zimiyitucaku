Go to your favourite podcast platform and listen to this genius who created @hollywoodunlocked, @gagnation and who I have a show with every single Monday night on @bigolive.usa. Allow me to introduce you to the REAL Jason LEE #stayunderconstructionüöß‚Äô Tamar captioned her post.</p><p>Someone said; ‚ÄòWhat you Do for a living should reflect who you are‚Ä¶if it not who you are, you shouldn‚Äôt be doing it.‚Äô</p><p>A commenter posted this message: ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre saved, shouldn‚Äôt you want to live according to the Word? Now I know we are all sinners, but if you‚Äôre a saved sinner and confess that Jesus is Lord and he got up on that cross to pay your penalty and you have been baptized in the Holy Spirit, shouldn‚Äôt you want to live for Him? To me, the Word clearly says as you become more like Him through knowing and living out his Word, through confession and worship that you desire less of the world, of fleshly things- so wouldn‚Äôt you want to abstain from a gay lifestyle? (or porn, gossip, lies, etc for example ‚Äì not just calling out gay)? I think too many Christians are more culturally minded than Christ minded ‚Äì how can we call ourselves the body of Christ when we are doing things He would never do? Going places He would never go? I think too many have made a God that is convenient for them to follow which is nothing but an idol. Get in the Word, and the Spirit will help you. This is a message of love so please receive it as such.‚Äô</p><p>One other follower posted this: ‚Äò@tamarbraxton Welcome to the New month of May Tamar. In this new month, the Lord will visit you in a new way, fill your heart with joy and peace, give you sound health and stability, give you pleasant surprises, keep you in all your ways, be your sun and shield and crown your efforts with great success in Jesus name. Amen. Good morning Queen and have a Wonderful New month of May.
