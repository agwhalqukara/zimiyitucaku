You can go all out or decorate it in a minimalist way. Check out amazing Christmas home décor ideas below.</p><h3>1. Good ol' tree</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5ef94a789f25e454.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are looking for simple Christmas decoration ideas, you can go for a medium tree and accessorise it with your preferred ornaments. Placing the tree near the mantel and next to a large window will make your living room look fabulous.</p><h3>2. Minimalistic plant décor</h3><p class=align-left>If you prefer a minimalistic look, go for plants. Use small evergreen plants to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">represent Christ's life </a>and eternal nature. You can place a wreath on the door and other plants on the cupboard in your entryway. These blend well with white candles.</p><h3>3. Lights & more lights</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/72714ad4366abbb8.jpg><p class=align-left>Did you know <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Christmas lights</a> remind Christians that Jesus Christ is the light of the <a href=#>world</a>? You can never go wrong with lights. They brighten your living area. You can have them hung on the tree, on the ceiling, and even on walls.</p><h3>4. Stockings by the mantel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/fdee3f1621c42440.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are looking for simple Christmas wall décor, consider hanging your stockings by the mantel. If you enjoy DIY crafts, you can knit or crochet your own stockings. Add some lights and a plant or two on top of the shelf above the mantel for a classy look.</p><h3>5. Giant tree by the window</h3><p class=align-left>If you love large trees, go ahead and get one for your living room. Use any DIY or store-bought ornaments to accessorise it. A large tree looks best in the corner of the living room, next to one or two large windows.</p><h3>6. DIY Ho Ho Ho</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/cef0e62efe34e733.jpg><p class=align-left>Do you have some cardboard, paint, scissors, and beads? If you do and love DIY projects, try making the above wooden wall décor items. Simply cut out cardboard letters in Ho Ho Ho, and paint them whichever way you like. Make them look like giant cookies for an interesting result.</p><h3>7. Dedicated wooden shelves</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3d308c2f78aadcff.jpg><p class=align-left>If you have little kids running around the home, consider installing wooden shelves for your decorations. Place your preferred ornaments on the shelves, where the kids cannot reach or drop them.</p><h3>8. Bring out the lantern</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8a043bc56e3177f4.jpg><p class=align-left>Lanterns play a significant role in social events and religious festivities.
