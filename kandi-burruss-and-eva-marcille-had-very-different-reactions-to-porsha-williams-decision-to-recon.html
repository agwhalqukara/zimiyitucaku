My husband’s really good friends with Dennis despite how it looks in the media and how crazy it actually was in real life. He loves her, and I believe that they are meant to be.”</p><p>The new mother stated: “And so it was just really funky for a while, and it happened at a time where everyone was able to see it. But I knew that when the dust cleared, and the sun rose, they would be okay.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Kandi explained that she was not expecting the new parents to reconcile.</p><p>She told Hollywood Life: “It did when it happened, because at first when we started the season, she was so done. But everybody could figure it out, I guess, especially when they have a beautiful baby.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B479NhynWrL/</p><p>Kandi also spoke about the wedding plans that Porsha and Dennis had for New Year’s Eve and explained that they might be hitting pause on the lavish event.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B41aFG5nGkh/</p><p>She explained: “I think she’s taking her time. I think she’s still trying to work on them as a couple and we’ll see. After I heard what I needed to hear, I got up and stormed out. At that point, I didn’t want to hear anymore because, for me, I had just heard my fiancé say that he actually had sex with someone while I was carrying our child. I didn’t want to hear anything else. There was nothing else I needed to hear, nothing I needed to say. I didn’t need to know the reasons. I didn’t need to know anything else.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-kSlDnmss/</p><p>Porsha confessed that she and Dennis were really over, and she even gave him back the 13-carat diamond engagement ring, and he moved out of the home they shared.</p><p>Porsha revealed: “I literally wish I could wake up and [have] somebody could be like, ‘It was a dream, it didn’t happen. The movie keeps playing in my head. I keep playing all of these moments. We’re, like, creating a real family, and just to think it wasn’t real is really hurtful.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kandi is good at spilling the tea.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblrultYybrKuqpajAbq3NnWSerpFiuqK%2BwqKjpZ1dna6ledWeqbJllJ6zp7HRnqWtZaKarqTAyKilrGWkpHqxu9Gsn5plp565rbXApqpmnJWYtrS1zqdkraddp7Kku82coKWdXay2tbSMnZynppmoeq6vyqKlpZ2pYq6nwMSrZK2glWKwqbHAraCnn12osKK6w5qjZmtkaH13go4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-statham-hunts-down-post-malone-in-wrath-of-man-trailer-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Statham Hunts Down Post Malone in 'Wrath of Man' Trailer - Watch!</span></a>
