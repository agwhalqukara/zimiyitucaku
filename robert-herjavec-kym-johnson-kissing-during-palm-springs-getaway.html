Dancing With the Stars‘ now-booted duo <strong>Robert Herjavec </strong>and<strong> Kym Johnson</strong> took their steamy on-screen chemistry entirely offscreen for a romantic getaway to Palm Springs, Calif., this weekend.</p><p>The season 20 dancing partners clearly could not keep their hands off each other and were snapped kissing while lounging outdoors. In another photo, the Shark Tank businessman wraps his arm closely around Johnson, while she rests her arm comfortably right above his butt. The images say enough — it’s hard to deny that something is happening here!</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=542 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kym and robert" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Johnson also posted a photo from their steamy getaway this past weekend, writing on Instagram: “Kick up your heels….it’s the weekend!”</p><p>Their latest PDA photos were taken days after the entrepreneur and the dancing pro <a href=#>shared a steamy kiss on the May 4 live broadcast of DWTS</a>. Fans swooned, but the two claimed it was for live TV purposes. “It was just part of the dance!” Johnson said backstage, while Herjavec chimed in: “We’re professional dancers, we were just in the moment.”</p><p>Johnson said the kiss caught her — along with the millions of viewers watching the show live — completely off guard. “We just thought, ‘Let’s see how we feel on the night’ and that’s what we did,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “We just — it took me by surprise because I didn’t know if he was going to do it or not.”</p><p>The lip-lock wasn’t enough to salvage their spot on the smash dance competition series, though, and the duo was booted off the following night. Backstage while speaking to Us Weekly and other reporters, she <a href=#>described their dynamic as “Kym-plicated</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>a source close to the dancing pair told <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>: “Kym and Robert were definitely attracted to each other from the get-go. He’s divorcing, so maybe he wants to find a new hot girlfriend. They are constantly all over each other. She can’t stop talking about what a good, nice guy he is. They have insane chemistry and are actually a great match.”</p><p>Herjavec split from his wife <strong>Diane Plese </strong>after 24 years of marriage in March. The Croatian entrepreneur, who shares three kids with Plese, told <a href=#>TMZ</a> at the time: “Human relationships are difficult.”</p><p>Just last month, Herjavec played coy about his rumored relationship with Johnson on Good Morning America. When the business mogul was asked about the beautiful blonde, he replied: “She’s a great dancer and she’s become a great friend. It’s more than just the dancing, I think we just got along great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmompWnwW60xKuhmq6VmHqsxcxmoaignqi8r3nKoqqsoZ6ceqXB0aKloGWglrmuedKpqaKml6h6qLHTmq6asV1nfXKBkGts</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./qui%C3%A9n-fue-la-esposa-de-jj-popeye-celebrity-fm.html><span>←</span><span>Quin fue la esposa de JJ Popeye?
