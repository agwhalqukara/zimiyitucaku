Brock Lesnar established his dominance in seconds. He hurled Dean Ambrose out of the ring before sending&nbsp;Roman Reigns to Suplex City.
The Beast Incarnate then started counting as he piled on the suplexes. After Ambrose slapped him, Lesnar then delivered punishment to The Lunatic Fringe.
Reigns nailed the big man with a Spear but couldn't get the three-count. He then teamed up with Ambrose to double-team Lesnar.
That left the two partners alone to batter each other.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>D-Backs' Luis Gonzalez on alleged 2003 steroid user list | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumo</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>
