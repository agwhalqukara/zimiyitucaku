He’s done a couple of&nbsp;small performances here and there, attended a few low-key events from time to time, but other than that, it’s been a long, impatient waiting game.</p><p>As expected, fans are&nbsp;delighted to hear from him. (He&nbsp;might be a few months later than he’d initially stated, but we can forgive him for that). Although his first tweet back doesn’t give us much, it sent fans into a frenzy.</p><p>https://twitter.com/edsheeran/status/808559335504744448</p><p>In edition to the square blue photo, he tweeted Ed also changed his Twitter icon and header to match. A few theories are going around, but most fans&nbsp;have come to an agreement. Ed’s previous two albums both had a color theme. + was orange, X was green. So blue must be the color scheme for his next album.</p><p>Unfortunately, this one little photo is the only update&nbsp;Ed’s given us so far. But after a year straight of absolutely no word from him, we’ll take whatever information we can get from him. Although we won’t lie, we all have his tweet notifications on as we wait for more.</p><p>What do you think Ed Sheeran has up his sleeve for us in the coming&nbsp;year? Send us a tweet at <a href=#>@CelebMix </a>to let us know your predictions! And keep an eye on our site&nbsp;for more information the minute it comes!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksqV50qGcnqqRo3qntc2ao6WxXZe%2Fpq3KrGSsoZyau6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barry-j-sanders-expected-to-commit-to-stanford-university.html><span>←</span><span>BARRY J.
