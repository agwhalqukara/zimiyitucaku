Previously, he served for several teams, including Anaheim Ducks, Washington Capitals, and Minnesota Wild. Additionally, he is the recipient of the Jack Adams Award for the NHL’s most outstanding head coach in the 2007-08 NHL season.</p><p>Talking about his personal life, Bruce is happily married to <strong>Crystal Boudreau,</strong> and it has already been many years. So, how did it start for the pair? What is Bruce Boudreau’s wife involved in? Let’s find out below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Met_In_The_Early_1990s></span>Met In The Early 1990s<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Crystal Boudreau is the popular ice hockey coach, Bruce Boudreau’s spouse. The <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">couple met in</a> 1991 at the Fort Wayne arena after a game. It was six months after Mr. Boudreau’s divorce was finalized. He was playing for Fort Wayne Komets of IHL, and Crystal was working in the souvenir shop in the Arena.</p><p>The pair started their relationship in 1992. Then, in 1995, the duo tied the knot. Ever since, the lovebirds have been enjoying their blissful marital journey. Their love for one another has grown more strong, and we hope their marriage lasts a lifetime.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Proud_Mother_Of_Four></span>A Proud Mother Of Four<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It has been three decades since Bruce and Crystal got together. On July 7, 1998, the duo welcomed their son, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Brady Boudreau</strong></a>. However, as per Brady’s Facebook, he was born on July 7, 1988. In addition, Crystal Boudreau’s son was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome when he was 14 years old.</p><p>Furthermore, when Mrs. Boudreau was 42 years old, she took myriad tests and discovered she also had it but was never diagnosed. Also, her baby boy scored 95 out of 100, and she was on a scale of around 78.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Living with Asperger’s, Brady Boudreau following in his dad’s hockey footsteps.

She <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">was born into</a> a baker’s family as she is the granddaughter of a baker. As a result, baking has always been a significant part of her life. Talking about her profession, she is a pastry chef.</p><p>As a child, Mrs. Boudreau spent holidays with siblings and cousins, creating a foundation for pastry experimentation, which later went on to become a major part of her process. Her journey from a delicious drop biscuit to her dessert catering business has really helped her hone her baking skills. As of 2017, the pastry chef had a new role at Sur La Table. There, she taught classes for all skill levels.</p><p>Apart from her own pastry business, Crystal also works alongside her husband. The couple formed Minnesota Blue Ox along with their partners. Apart from the franchise, they also formed the Hershey Cubs in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cyrstal-and-Bruce-formed-a-hockey-franchise.jpg><p>Hence, the married duo has been achieving significant success in their business ventures. Crystal is supportive of Bruce and often accompanies him to many events or games. We look forward to knowing more about her in the coming days. Hopefully, she is doing well for herself. We hope Crystal has a sound health and blissful days in the future.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcK7RrpqeZZKkwqW%2BxJqsZq%2BZm7Jur9Gyqq2ZnGKvsMHDq5yarV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wife-wedding-family-net-worth-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Wife, Wedding, Family, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
