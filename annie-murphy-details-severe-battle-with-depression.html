That’s not normal,’” <strong>Annie</strong> recalled to <a href=#>The Zoe Report</a>, noting that she subsequently saw a therapist who diagnosed her with depression. “I was like, ‘Damn it, I’m depressed.’”</p><p>“A lot of people are going to think that I sound like I’m playing a tiny violin for myself,” <strong>Annie</strong> continued. “‘Oh, you’re rich and famous. Why the f–k are you sad? You have nothing to be sad about.’ But I’m not going to post photos of me covered in my own snot, lying on the floor, unable to get up. I don’t want people to have to see that.”</p><p><strong>Annie</strong> shared how the lockdown went into effect on the same day she was supposed to start filming Kevin Can F–k Himself, which was on March 12, 2020.</p><p>“As excited as I was to get this huge part on [Kevin Can F**k Himself], I do not think if I had gone to work when I was supposed to go to work, I would have been able to do my job,” <strong>Annie</strong> said.</p><p><strong>Annie</strong> went on to say that once she started taking antidepressants and started seeing a therapist regularly, she was able to get to a more stable mental state.</p><p>“I do not cry every single day on the floor 12 times. I am able to focus on other things in my life,” <strong>Annie</strong> said. “Now, honestly, if a friend’s like, ‘I’m having a really hard time,’ I’m like, ‘Get on drugs. Get on drugs!’ You don’t have to be on drugs for the whole time.”</p><p><strong>Annie</strong> additionally credits antidepressants as something that “truly saved my life” because it helped her to become “a functional human being.”</p><p>In another recent interview, <strong>Annie</strong> <a href=#>explained why she took the role in Kevin Can F–k Himself</a> after starring as Alexis Rose on Schitt’s Creek.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomZ6jtqZ5zK6pqaCpYrGmwMCio6xlo5rDpr7EZpmarKShsm7DyK2fZpyVpb%2Bmv9Kipqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wwe-rumors-on-chad-gable-s-contract-tama-tonga-backstage-and-natalya-s-future-news-scores-highl.html><span>←</span><span>WWE Rumors on Chad Gable's Contract, Tama Tonga Backstage and Natalya's Future | News, Scores, Highl</span></a>
