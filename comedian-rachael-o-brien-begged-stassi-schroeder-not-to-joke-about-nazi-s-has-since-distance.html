She claims that was the turning point in their friendship.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBCIgw0lw19/</a></p><p>‘A little over two years ago I was with friends and took a picture. I saw the way it was being captioned by her and begged for it not to be captioned that way and thus posted. My attempt for her to understand the severity of her caption went dismissed. That request was not honored, and I have been upset ever since. It was not then, nor has it ever been a reflection of my own value system. I am grateful to not be associated with her anymore. Our personalities and hearts are not the same.’</p><p>This comes after <a href=#>Stassi and Kristen were fired from Vanderpump Rules for a slew of things</a>.</p><p>This was triggered by Faith Stowers finally speaking on what the friends did to her after she left Vanderpump Rules.</p><p>Although Faith had spoken up before, it wasn’t taken as seriously as it’s being taken now due to the #amplifymelanatedvoices movement.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for what Rachael’s doing to be anti-racist, she’s offering free advertising space to black owned businesses on her podcast.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTpLqmsMiapWaqkZi1orHLZqabqpmau26uxKCenpxdqMGiv9KiZKybmKe8prDEq2Snp6RiwbB5yaiinmWRl7y2wIynmLOho2K1or%2BMrKCnm5Visaq%2F05qlnJ2UYrWmvtKeo59llqe8rnnVmqWdnaKlwq68jKuspZ2jYsC1rdFma2ltY22GcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-overseas-crossword-clue-nyt.html><span>←</span><span>A overseas Crossword Clue NYT</span></a>
