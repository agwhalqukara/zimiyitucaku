Earlier this week, he shared an Instagram photo after crossing paths with his half-sister <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> and boyfriend <strong>Tyga</strong> while on a walk in their shared Calabasas, Calif. neighborhood. On Aug. 14 older sister <strong>Kim</strong> revealed she and her brother worked up a sweat hiking as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“Just went on the hardest hike ever today with @robkardashian,” she tweeted. On Aug. 25 she also shared, “Rise & Grind! Workout time!!!!! With @robkardashian.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s always in and out. He makes it work with his schedule and he’s on his path,” his trainer <strong>Gunnar Peterson</strong> tells <strong>Us Weekly</strong> of Rob’s workout regimen. “In the scheme of life this is a chapter, it’s not The Book Of Rob. Watch him be better than ever! Watch! I’m taking all bets!”</p><p>As sister and roommate <strong>Khloe </strong>previously explained, Rob has his good days and his bad days.</p><p>“Rob definitely has his ups and downs, and he’s been struggling for the past year and a half, maybe two years, which I think we’ve all had those times in our life,” Khloe told E! News in April. “He’s been working out a little and trying to get his groove back. And he acknowledges it! He’s aware that he’s very introverted and of course not the way he used to be. I think being aware is probably the best thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKmoml2grrOwwKyfopmeYq%2BtrcyeqmalmaG4tLTApJysZZakv27DxKKeoaxdnK6quoxrZ2ptYmyF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dorothy-dandridge-movie-actress-age-birthday-bio-facts-family-net-worth-height-more.html><span>←</span><span>Dorothy Dandridge (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
