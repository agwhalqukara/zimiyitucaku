The Nightcrawler actor attended the biggest night in fashion alongside not one, not two, but three famous ex-girlfriends! <a href=#><strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> were all in attendance on the red carpet, but it appears as though none of the women made their way to Gyllenhaal for a photo-op during the overwhelmingly star-packed evening.</p><p>At the Met Gala, a much scruffier Jake, 33, escorted Maggie, 36, as his date. He donned a black shirt, pants, and a white blazer. Dunst, meanwhile, wore an <a href=#>asymmetrical black gown</a> designed by Rodarte. Witherspoon stunned in a Mad Men-inspired rosy pink Stella McCartney ensemble (Betty Draper, anyone?) as Swift slipped into a <a href=#>light pink Oscar de la Renta gown.</a></p><p>Gyllenhaal dated Dunst for two years until their split back in 2004 in what most consider his first high-profile romance in Hollywood. At the time, the couple shared an L.A. home and a dog named Atticus.</p><p>The pair have rarely spoken of each other since, but didn’t seem to part on bad terms. Back in November 2009, the Two Faces of January actress kept the Gyllenhaal talk to a minimum in an <a href=#>interview with Allure.</a> “It would be nice to see him,” she said. “But we’re not good friends.” Dunst has been dating actor <strong>Garrett Hedlund</strong> <a href=#>since early 2012.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Gyllenhaal’s next longterm relationship was with Witherspoon. The twosome met on set of the film Rendition and took their relationship public in March 2007. <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong> broke news</a> that the pair called it quits in December 2009 after nearly three years together.</p><p>“She felt pressured to wed again but she wasn’t ready,” an insider told <strong>Us</strong> of Witherspoon. “She couldn’t give Jake enough and she got cold feet. Jake wanted all of her.” Although a source told <strong>Us</strong> there was “no drama” between the pair, an insider said the split broke Gyllenhaal’s heart.</p><p>At the time, Witherspoon was mom to only daughter <strong>Ava</strong>, now 15, and son <strong>Deacon</strong>, now 11, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong></a>. Since the breakup, she married CAA agent <strong>Tim Roth</strong> in March 2011; the couple welcomed son <a href=#><strong>Tennessee</strong> in September 2012.</a></p><p>Gyllenhaal may have been heartbroken from Witherspoon, but it was the actor who did the dumping during his <a href=#>whirlwind two-month romance</a> with Swift, 24. The youngest one out of his exes, Swift fell head over heels for the heartthrob back in 2011.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Vogue.com photos — Best Met Gala gowns of all time</a></p><p>“It was a 180-degree turn and so out of the blue,” <a href=#>a source told <strong>Us</strong></a> of the split at the time. “Jake just told her it wasn’t working out…Taylor is really upset and hurt. She doesn’t know what she did for him to put a stop to it. She feels really burned by him.”</p><p>The sad experience, however, inspired several songs (including the heart-wrenching “All Too Well”) off her 2011 Red album. Swift admitted last November that she “heard from the guy” that most of the album was about. “He was like, ‘I just listened to the album, and that was a really bittersweet experience for me,'” she recalled to <a href=#>New York magazine</a><a href=#>.</a> “‘It was like going through a photo album.’ That was nice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGao5VitLq4y56loZmRoXqmxMSsZJ2tnqjBbsPIrZ%2BeqqOlvLC6jKyuop6kYq61wMSnm2allal6qK3LmmRraGFpenN8kG1tbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dineo-ranaka-raises-concerns-after-opening-up-about-battle-with-depression-life-is-so-hard.html><span>←</span><span>Dineo Ranaka Raises Concerns After Opening Up About Battle With Depression: Life Is So Hard</span></a>
