They been engaged since B.C😂.”</p><p>“They have been engaged since I was in diapers…and I’m 34 lolzzz😭.”</p><p>“The relationship was dead when she proposed.”</p><p>“He ain’t holding her down he holding her back and holding her up 😒.”</p><p>“I think you mean hold her back 🥴😩.”</p><p>“What is he waiting on? Ain’t nobody else willing to hold him down harder than her 😩.”</p><p>“Fiancé still? It’s been like 7+ years 🙁 What’s the hold-up”.</p><p>The returning “Love and Hip Hop” reality stars got engaged in 2012, and they’ve been together since 2004. In a recent interview with “The Real,” Lampkin mentioned that she “wanted to get back to the essence of the show.”</p><p>She also noted that “LHHNY” producers reached out to her first about returning. When asked why she and Jones haven’t made it official, Lampkin said marriage wasn’t a “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="priority anymore (opens in a new tab)">priority anymore</a>.”</p><p>“Our relationship is in a good place,” Lampkin continued. “I thought that [marriage] was the natural progression, but it’s not for everybody. We’re good right now.”</p><p>Some fans weren’t buying Lampkin’s response about marriage, not being a “priority anymore.”</p><p>“Chrissy, come on! I don’t understand how it’s not a priority. Then go to the courthouse!”</p><p>“If your dating for yearssss and marriage is not a priority …idk Mann 🤦🏾‍♀️.</p><p>I have no idea what to tell you.”</p><p>Lampkin didn’t skew off from a statement she made to Billboard in 2016 about a long-term engagement with Jones.</p><p>“I don’t want to get married before either one of us is really ready, then what’s the sense? That ends in divorce,” she said. “People move at their own pace. I’m still here because it’s my choice.”</p><p>Jones and Lampkin will return on season 10 of VH1’s “LHHNY” on Monday, Dec.16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e5BrZmlwX52ybrTOpZuippdixrDBjJ2msKZdlrulecGamqRlmp66brbOp5ysZZiarrPAxZ6jrWWgpMC1edOoZJ%2BhkaOwprGMnJ%2BroaOoxm64wKanpKGeYrGmvsCio6xlp52yr3nFmqWsZZKntq%2BzjK6nZrGVlr%2B0ecuopaBllaO0orPEppynrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./escobar-paradise-lost-true-story-behind-the-film.html><span>←</span><span>Escobar: Paradise Lost: True Story Behind the Film</span></a>
