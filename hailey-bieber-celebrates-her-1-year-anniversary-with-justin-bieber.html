Around two weeks later, insiders, who spoke with ET confirmed they were married.</p><p>Paraphrasing what the source explained at the time, Justin and Hailey were thrilled to get married and literally couldn’t wait, however, they wanted to keep it a big secret for the sake of privacy. Moreover, they still intend on having a more formal ceremony, but for now, things are good the way they are.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Y3Bqyg3Nc/</p><p>Reportedly, Justin and Hailey are actually getting ready to have their second wedding attended by family and friends later in September in the state of South Carolina. Sources who spoke with the aforementioned outlet stated they were “gearing up” for the most spectacular event of their lives.</p><p>As fans of the couple know, Hailey and Justin are both, incredibly religious, with Hailey, in particular, coming from a long line of relatively pious family members. Justin Bieber, on the other hand, turned to God and organized religion after his meteoric rise to fame as a teenage boy.</p><p>For years, Justin’s life and reputation were marred by incidents with the paparazzi, crazed fans, and lawsuits. However, after finding faith in God, the singer appeared to turn over a new leaf, moreover, his music, including Purpose, his last big album, began to reflect his religious convictions.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Justin was previously linked to fellow pop-star, Selena Gomez, who has struggled with mental health issues as well. Reportedly, Selena checked herself into a mental health facility following news of Justin’s engagement to Hailey Bieber, but it was never confirmed if that was the reason for Gomez’s stay in the facility.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeYlratsdhmmaKdkpq%2Fbq%2FEpZybqpGpsrR5x56pZmldrrKivoyapaehppq%2FtK3RsmSwoaSdeqvB0q2gp2WSnrKjsdFmamtoaGaCcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bae-doona-wiki-age-husband-net-worth-boyfriend-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Bae Doona- Wiki, Age, Husband, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
