Instead, here are some of the best tips on how to catch small fairies in Tears of the Kingdom:</p><li><strong>Walk or Sneak</strong> – Don’t run near them as they’ll fly away.</li><li><strong>Be patient </strong>– They move around constantly, and they might end up being too high for you to catch them. Just wait until they get back down again.</li><li><strong>Avoid shooting them </strong>– Don’t use arrows or any other throwable. The only way to catch them is by getting close.</li><p>Also, make sure to unlock shrines near the fairy spots shown above. Whenever you’re out of fairies, you will be able to come back and restock easily.</p><p>As for using them, you don’t have to do anything. After having a small fairy in your inventory, it will automatically get used the next time you’re about to die.</p><p>All it takes is having it in your inventory, and you’ll get revived upon dying.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wrapping up</h2><p>To sum up, these are all the small fairy locations in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p>Collect as many as you need and activate the shrines nearby to restock whenever needed.
